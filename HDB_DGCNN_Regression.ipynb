We expect the DGCNN to work better by taking into account geospatial relationships with 1) nearby recent sales, 2) nearby malls, 3) nearby MRTs. This should give us a more localised prior to do inference. Instead of getting MLP to learn every single feature, we extract relevant priors to make inference easier. We hope to see the DGCNN perform better than the MLP.
